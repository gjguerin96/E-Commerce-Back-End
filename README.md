# E-Commerce-Back-End

## Description
This application focuses on how CRUD routes are used to interact with a database. It relies on sequelize works, so I learned a lot about sequelize while working on it. The application has no front end, but can be accessed with insomnia.  

## Installation
Run npm install to install the necessary node packages, use mysql to source the schema, and use node to access the seeds.

## Usage
See video walkthrough below. Use node to activate the server from the command line, and then use insomnia to access the get, post, put, and delete routes for the models (tags, categories, and products).

## Credits
This application was partly pre-built, I added to the models, routes, and the server file.
